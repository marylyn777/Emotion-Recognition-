# Emotion-Recognition-CNN
Emotion Recognition Using CNN and FER2013
This project implements a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) for real-time facial emotion recognition using the FER2013 dataset. Built with PyTorch, OpenCV, and Gradio, the system classifies facial expressions into seven emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral. It features a user-friendly GUI for image/video input and live webcam inference. Designed for practical deployment, the model balances simplicity, accuracy, and speed.
